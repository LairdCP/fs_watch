fs_watch

This program is a basic filesystem watcher using inotify. It's based on the example
program in inotify-tools and thus is governed by the GPL v2.

It is hard-coded to watch the entire filesystem starting with / and can be passed exclude
directories in the form of "@/directory". It outputs on stdout and is best combined
with logger to write to the syslog.

A typical command-line, suitable for including in an init.d script:
    /usr/bin/fs_watch @/dev @/tmp @/sys @/proc | logger -t fs_watch &
